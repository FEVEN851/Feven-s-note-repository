- LINUX is kernel
- **Kernel**:- is a code or program that is used to **meet your software and hardware**. and it allocate some resources.
- in history of Linux, in 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer.
  - it was chosen because of Thompson's familiarity with the system from his hobby work on it.
  - but it wasn't cheap and open source.
-  then Linus Trovalds created the **Linux kernel** which hasnt software . And posted it online to make it open- source
- the type of programming language that Linus used to code the Linux kernel is **C**.
- After some years (in 1983), Richard Stallman announced the GNU project(all application name) and cofounded the free software foundation in 1985.
- GNU is a **free software replacement to the UNIX OS**, but it was just software replacement not full OS(e.gs: bash, tar, emacs...).
- So, GNU+LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.
- The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like operating system created with source code that could be copied, modified, and redistributed.
## What is shell
- In cybersecurity, a **shell** refers to a command-line interface that allows users to interact with a computer or server by entering commands Specifically, a **web shell** is a malicious script that threat actors use to compromise web servers and launch additional attacks.
- shell translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel
the name of the shell in Linux is called terminal and the name of the shell in windows is called cmd however, windows newly discovered and updated shell is called power shell. 
### Types of shell
- **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**:

1.  **Bash** (short for **Bourne-Again SHell**) is a Unix shell and command language supported by the Free Software Foundation. It was initially developed for the GNU Project by Brian Fox in 1989. Here are some key points about Bash:

   -  **Shell and Command Interpreter**: Bash serves as both an interactive login shell and a command interpreter. It executes commands and provides a terminal interface for interacting with the operating system.
   - **Compatibility**: It is designed as a 100% free software alternative to the original Bourne shell (sh). Bash is compatible with sh and conforms to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard
   - **Features**:
    - **Command-Line Editing**: Bash offers command-line editing, making it easier to modify and reuse commands.
    -  **Job Control**: You can manage background processes and switch between them.
    - **Shell Functions and Aliases**: Define custom functions and aliases for convenience.
    - **Indexed Arrays**: Bash supports arrays of unlimited size.
    - **Integer Arithmetic**: Perform arithmetic operations in any base from two to sixty-four
    bash is widely used on most Linux distributions and is a successor to the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh). It’s a powerful tool for both interactive use and scripting tasks!
2. **Zsh** (Z shell) is a Unix shell that serves as both an interactive login shell and a command interpreter for shell scripting. Here are some key points about Zsh:

    -  **Extended Features**: Zsh is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh) with numerous improvements. it incorporates features from other shells like **Bash**, **ksh**, and **tcsh**
     - **Notable Features**:
        1. **Automatic cd**: You can simply type the name of a directory to change into it.
        2. **Recursive path expansion**: For instance, typing `/u/lo/b` expands to `/usr/local/bin`.
        3. **Syntax Highlighting**: Words, file extensions, and visible elements in the terminal are color-coded.
        4. **Spelling correction and approximate completion**: Zsh helps fix minor typos in directory names.
        5. **Plugin and theme support**: Zsh allows customization through various plugin frameworks.
     - **Installation**:
       -   On **Ubuntu** or other Debian-based distributions, install Zsh using `sudo apt install zsh`. Change the default shell with `chsh -s $(which zsh)`.
      -   On **Fedora**, use `sudo dnf install zsh` and switch to Zsh by running `zsh` in the terminal
3. **KornShell** (ksh) is a Unix shell developed by David Korn at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. Let’s explore some key points about it:

    -   **Purpose and Origin**:
      -  KornShell was announced at USENIX on July 14, 1983.
      - Its initial development was based on the Bourne shell source code.
      - David Korn, along with other contributors, designed it to be backward-compatible with the Bourne shell while incorporating features inspired by the C shell
    -   **Features**:
        - **Job Control**: KornShell introduced job control features, allowing users to manage background processes.
        - **Command Aliasing**: Users can create aliases for frequently used commands.
        - **Command History**: Similar to the C shell, KornShell provides command history features.
        - **Command-Line Editing Styles**: Users can choose from vi, Emacs, or Gosling Emacs-style editing.
        - **Associative Arrays**: KornShell supports associative arrays.
        - **Floating-Point Arithmetic**: Available in the ksh93 version.
        - **Dynamic Extensibility**: Built-in commands can be dynamically loaded (since ksh93).
        - **Object-Oriented Features**: Variables can have member functions, and object-oriented programming is possible (since ksh93t).
    -  **Licensing**:
    
        - Initially proprietary, KornShell’s source code was released under the Eclipse Public License.
        - It remains a powerful and interactive shell used in Unix-like systems.
         KornShell—it offers a rich set of features for both interactive use and scripting!
4. **Fish** (Friendly Interactive SHell) is a modern and consistent command-line shell for Linux, macOS, and other platforms. Here are some key features:
         - **Interactivity**: Fish emphasizes interactivity by default, making it user-friendly without requiring extensive configuration. Unlike Zsh, which relies on user customization, Fish aims to provide a great experience out of the box
         - **Syntax Highlighting**: Fish supports syntax highlighting, making commands and code more readable in the terminal.
         - **Autosuggestions**: As you type, Fish suggests commands based on your history and completions, similar to how a web browser suggests URLs.
         - **Abbreviations**: Tired of typing long commands? Fish allows you to create abbreviations for frequently used commands.
         - **Color Support**: Fish supports 24-bit true color, adding a touch of vibrancy to your terminal experience.
         - **Web-Based Configuration**: If you’re using a graphical environment, you can configure Fish via a web page. Otherwise, you can still set preferences directly in the terminal.
## What is OS- operating system?
- we have said UNIX and GNU/Linux as OS 
- OS is operating system which means the main software part of computer that helps to work on.
- it includes
     - kernel
     - software
     - desktop environment(is an implementation of the desktop metaphor—a bundle of programs running on top of an operating system. It provides a common graphical user interface (GUI) or “graphical shell.” DEs include icons, windows, toolbars, folders, wallpapers, and widgets. They aim to make interacting with the computer intuitive, using concepts like buttons and windows) some basic desktop environments in Linux are-
         - mate-  suitable for low pc performance
         - gnome- (beautiful desktop environment)
         - KDE plasma (similar to windows) for low pc performance
         - XFCE- for low pc performance
     - file extension
     - window manager

- DO WINDOWS HAVE DISTROS?
     - windows is not open-source so peoplees wont use
     - it just give updates and adds some feature on it.
- how can we install and use Linux?
     - Main OS/ main boot:- only for Linux OS no window OS.
     - Dual boot:- 2 in 1 (you have to shut down and restart).
     - Live boot- it uses our flash as storage and our pc as a a processor.
     - cloud terminal- [1](https://www.webminal.org)
     - virtual machine- medium processor pc
        - computers have a technology called "VIRTUALIZATION". this is the method how it allocate our using memory to the virtual machine(VM)
        - this is a method to use windiows and linux **together**
        - soft ware that gives you this ability are:
            - HyberV
            - QEMU
            - Virtual Box- Oracle
            - VMware(recomended)
            - ...
         - systems that you havve to check virtualization is working
             1.  open task manager
             2. go to performance
             3. Open cpu
         -   it there are some disabilities, you have to enable in BIOS settings 
    - if it is enabled, we are good to go.
    - to check that wheather it is enabled or disabled, we have to use the shortcut ctrl+shift+esc->CPU-> virtualization(enabled or disabled).
- WSL (windows subsystem for linux)v2- for low performance computer
- Termux- for running some code in your phone and dused to run simple codes with limited tools.
