- cyber- relating to computer culture (such as internet, virtual reality...)
- cyber security; a very wide field in the information technology world
- it is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks
- these cyber attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users via ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.
- those cyber attacks are sometimes called ==HACKING.==.
**WHAT IS HACKING?**
- hacking is referred to exploiting system **vulnerabilities**(weakness) and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- ethical hacking finds the weak points loopholes in a computer, web application, or network and reports them to the organization.
- the person who do the hacking is called HACKER.
**TYPES OF HACKERS BASED  ON ETHICS**
- black hat hackers- the most evil and bad peoples in the cyber space.
- white hat- the helping and good peoples.
- grey hat hackers- individuals who sometimes act ethically and other times engage in questionable or illegal activities.
-TYPES OF HACKERS BASED ON SKILL
- Newible/noob- don`t have any knowledge about hacking.
- script kiddie/skid/- is relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others, primarily for malicious purposes.
- hacker- perfectly skilled, with less experience.
- elite/pro hacker- perfectly skilled, with much more experience.
-why do we  learn hacking
- to prevent hacers from gaining access
- to uncover vulnerabilities
- to strengthen the organization
- to safeguard the data
- to avoid security breaches
- to enhance security awareness
- to get a job
-who can be an ethical hacker
- knowledge of technology/ security areas
- ability to learn
- strong work ethics
- forensic and security people
-why hack happens
- attacks= motive (goal)+method+ vulnerability.
- motive- information theft manipulating data, financial loss, revenge, ransom, damaging reputation.
-elements of information security
1. confidentiality; the information is safe from accidental or international disclosure.
2. integrity- the information is safe from accidental or intentional modification  or alteration.
3. availability- the information is available to **authorized** users when needed.
-skills we need to be hacker
- computer programming
- computer networking
- system understanding
 - linux
 - windows
 PHASES OF HACKING
 - reconnaissance- information gathering
 - scanning
 - gaining access
 - maintaining  access
 - clearing tracks or logs\
 penetration testing
 - penetration testing- is a method of evaluating the security of an information system or network by simulating an attack to;
   - find vulnerability
   - security measures
   - documentation and report operation
why we need penetration testing
- identification of threats
- security protections and controls
- assessment of organization`s security
- upgradation of infrastructure
-types of pentesting
Black box pentesting:- testing system without prior knowledge and you test as an attacker.
white box pentesting- testing system without prior knowledge. and you test as a developer.
grey box pentesting- testing system with limited knowledge. and you test as a user.

CYBER SECURITY FIELD TERMS
1. RED TEAM- these peoples are offensive, and trying to attack and try to gain access, then report the way they got in. e.g pentetion tester.
2. vulnerability- these are peoples, who do some security check based on some list.
3. security audit- a comprehensive evaluation of an organizations security controls,policies,and procedures e.g- FISMA.PCI DSS.HIPPA. ISO 27001
4. blue team- they are defensive peoples who will do firewalls and try to protect you.
JOBS WITH ETHICAL HACKING
- cyber security expert
- security analyst
- cyber security consultant
- web penetration test
- internal and external penetration tester
- network security tester
- bug hunter
ETHICS OF CYBER SECURITY
 1. `respect the privacy of others.
 2. `think  before you type
 3. `with great power comes great responsibility
- ethics is the most important concept in cyber security.
- we always need permission to hack because Ethiopia has a crime law.(3-5 yrs and 10k-50k eth birr). so we have to think before we type.
